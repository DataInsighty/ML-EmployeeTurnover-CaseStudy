# ML-EmployeeTurnover-CaseStudy
Machine Learning-Based Prediction of employee turnover intention: A Case Study

LAZA Soft is a software company located in the Colombo City area of Sri Lanka. In recent years organization experiencing employee turnover is a costly problem for organizations, both in terms of lost productivity and the cost of hiring and training new employees. It is estimated that the average cost of replacing an employee is 1.5-2 times the employee's annual salary. According to the data presented in Table 1, there is evidence to suggest that there has been an increase in the employee turnover rate, and higher than the industry benchmark.

Turnover percentage as follows
2020 - 15% , 2021	-  18% , 2022	- 19%
 
The significance of job satisfaction lies in its ability to attract and retain high-caliber personnel. Moreover, the maintenance of job satisfaction can foster employee loyalty and mitigate turnover intentions. Furthermore, it is worth noting that job satisfaction has the potential to mitigate work-related stress, hence diminishing the likelihood of an employee's intention to terminate their employment. The objective of this study using Machine Learning techniques to predict employee turnover intention within the job satisfaction context of LAZA Soft.
 
Questions:
 
•	What are the job satisfaction factors contributing to employee turnover?
•	How machine learning be used to identify employees who are at risk of leaving the organization?
•	How can the results of machine learning be used to improve employee retention?
 
 
Objectives:
•	To identify the most important factors that contribute to employee turnover.
•	To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict employee turnover.
•	To develop a risk assessment tool that can identify employees who are at risk of leaving the organization.
 
The data used for the study will include employee surveys conducted

 
Expected Results: The expected results of the study are that machine learning can be used to predict employee turnover intention with high accuracy. This information can be used by organizations to identify employees who are at risk of leaving and take steps to prevent them from doing so.
